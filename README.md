Who wouldn't want confused Travolta gif in their browser when they visit a page that does not exist?
That's right **everyone** wants that.

Just look at it, it's beautiful:

Afterwards just visit any nonexistent URl (like http://www.nonexistent-url.com) and be mesmerized by its beauty.

## Installation

If your immediate reaction was "wow, that's so cool, I want it in my Firefox like yesterday!!!1!1!", today is your lucky
day.

Just had to the [latest release](https://github.com/RikudouSage/FirefoxTravoltaMemePatch/releases/latest), download the
installer and run it. That's how easy it is.

> After every Firefox update this patch will be undone and needs to be installed again.

## Uninstallation

Why would someone uninstall this? Whatever your reason may be, just head to your Firefox installation directory
(default is `C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox`), then open directory `browser` and delete the `omni.ja` file. Afterwards
rename the file `omni.ja.backup` to `omni.ja`.

If this is too technical for you, just [download Firefox installer](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/download/thanks/)
and install it (you don't need to uninstall it first and your data won't be deleted).
